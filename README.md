## OpenDungeonsPlus

OpenDungeonsPlus is an open source, real time strategy game sharing game elements
with the Dungeon Keeper series and Evil Genius. Players build an underground
dungeon which is inhabited by creatures. Players fight each other for control
of the underground by indirectly commanding their creatures, directly casting
spells in combat, and luring enemies into sinister traps.

The game is developed by a friendly community of developers and artists, and
has now reached a quite playable and enjoyable status after more than 6 years
of development.

### How to play

Future versions will have an in-game tutorial, but for now, you can use the
following resources to learn the basic gameplay concepts:

- In-game help screen, toggled with the F1 key
- Video tutorial (version 0.5.0): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4MClQUdb0E
- Wiki page: https://github.com/OpenDungeons/OpenDungeons/wiki/Gameplay

You can play singleplayer levels using the Skirmish menu, or host/join a
multiplayer game by using the corresponding menus.

### Build instructions

If you retrieve the source code of OpenDungeonsPlus and want to have a go at
building it yourself, have a look at platform-specific build instructions
on our wiki: https://github.com/OpenDungeons/OpenDungeons/wiki/Compile

In a few words, to build OpenDungeonsPlus, you need the following libraries:

- OGRE SDK (1.9.x)
- Boost (same version that OGRE was linked against)
- CEGUI SDK (0.8.x)
- SFML (2.x)
- OIS

You will also need a recent CMake version (2.8 or newer) and a compiler
that supports C++11 features reasonably well, i.e.:

- Linux: GCC 4.8+
- Windows: MSVS 2013 Express or MinGW 4.8+

On an UNIX system, you can then run:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -jX    // X is the number of CPU cores that you want to allocate  
```
And run the *opendungeons* output binary.

### Contributing code

If you want to contribute code, you should take a look at our coding
guidelines: https://github.com/OpenDungeons/OpenDungeons/wiki/Code-Guidelines

It contains a rather deep introduction on how we name, indent, structure and
extend our code. It also has some performance optimisation tips.
