# Configuring and compiling on Windows

As of September 5, 2026. The [prerequisites](WINDOWS-DEV-SETUP.md) are installed
and CMake and the Windows x64 game builds in Release and Debug have
completed successfully; game startup has not yet been tested in practice.
The four resolved build errors and their evidence are recorded in
[WINDOWS-BUILD-FIXES.md](WINDOWS-BUILD-FIXES.md).

## 1. Prepare the PowerShell session

In a new PowerShell console:

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'C:\Users\mario\GitHub\OpenDungeonsPlus'
. .\scripts\win32\Enter-OpenDungeonsPlus.ps1
```

The dot at the start loads the compiler and search paths into the same session;
then configure and build in this console. CMake 3.31.8,
Python 3.10.11 and the x64 compiler from Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools are expected.
If needed, check without building:

```powershell
Get-Command cl.exe, cmake.exe, python.exe | Select-Object Name, Source
cmake --version
python --version
```

## 2. Configure CMake

```powershell
& .\scripts\win32\configure-windows-prereqs.ps1
```

The script also loads the environment helper itself and uses:

- Source: project root, derived from the script path.
- Build directory: `build\windows`.
- Generator: `Visual Studio 17 2022`, architecture `x64`.
- `OD_BUILD_TESTING=OFF` and `BUILD_TESTING=OFF`.
- Installation target: `build\windows\install`.
- Python under `C:\Users\mario\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310`:
  `python.exe`, `include`, `libs\python310.lib`, `libs\python310_d.lib`.

The configuration log is replaced on every invocation:
`C:\Users\mario\od-deps\logs\opendungeons-configure.log`.
On errors, the script prints the last lines and aborts.
Reconfigure after changes to CMake files or source lists;
for ordinary changes to existing C++ files, use the existing build.

## 3. Build the game

Release from the same prepared console:

```powershell
cmake --build .\build\windows --config Release --parallel 4
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'Release game build failed' }
```

For Debug instead:

```powershell
cmake --build .\build\windows --config Debug --parallel 4
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'Debug game build failed' }
```

The successfully generated output files are
`build\windows\opendungeons-plus.exe` and `build\windows\opendungeons-plus_d.exe`,
directly in the build directory. Both files were checked for their AMD64 PE signature and
the corresponding Python DLL without starting the game.
The build output appears in the console; if an error occurs, record the first specific
compiler/linker message and the configuration used.
The logged successful verification runs for this setup are located
under `build\windows\game-Release-pass3.log` and `game-Debug-pass3.log`.

## 4. Game startup and manual verification

The user should only test after a successful build; the following startup command
has not yet been verified in practice and requires the same loaded environment:

```powershell
Push-Location -LiteralPath .\build\windows
try {
    & .\opendungeons-plus.exe
} finally {
    Pop-Location
}
```

For Debug, use the file `opendungeons-plus_d.exe`.
CMake generates `plugins.cfg`, `plugins_d.cfg`, `resources.cfg` and links
to the game data here. If DLLs or plugins are missing, examine the actual startup error;
DLL distribution, plugin loading and game startup are still pending.
The user performs manual game tests and visual acceptance.

## Logs and resuming work

- Current installation and verification status: [WINDOWS-DEV-SETUP.md](WINDOWS-DEV-SETUP.md).
- Library logs: `C:\Users\mario\od-deps\logs\<name>-configure.log`,
  `<name>-Release.log`, `<name>-Debug.log`; Boost uses
  `boost-bootstrap.log` and `boost-build.log`.
- Rebuild dependencies only when actually needed, following
  [WINDOWS-PREREQUISITES.md](WINDOWS-PREREQUISITES.md).

`build` is excluded from Git and contains generated files;
`build\windows` also contains directory junctions to project resources.
Take these junctions into account when cleaning up and do not delete source directories through them.
After a new result, add the date, configuration used, error or success
and remaining checks to the Windows status document.
